summary: Terraform Pull Request Automation.

description: |
  A charm providing Terraform pull request automation using [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/).

  When PRs are generated against a Terraform config repository this charm can be configured to listen for a webhook which then triggers it to run `terraform plan` and post that to the PR. Reviewers can then post a message that will trigger this service to apply the changes if appropriate.

  Improve your Terraform workflow, making it easier for devops teams to collaborate on infrastructure changes.

  This charm is useful for teams wanting to automate their Terraform workflows.
